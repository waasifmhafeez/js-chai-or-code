// null => in JS null it seld is a stand alone value, null is representation of empty value, empty value doesnt means let name = "" ; its means its a 
//         empty string. let temp = null .suppose you are get temp from a api but temp is available due to some issue so in this case you can't 
//         provide zero because zero it self a number, so null is prefered in this case
// undefined => undefined is when you have not assign any value. let name; means a variable is declared but its value is not defined yet
// symbol => its used for uniqueness

// objects

console.log(typeof "hitesh")

console.log(typeof null) // when you check type of null result will be object
